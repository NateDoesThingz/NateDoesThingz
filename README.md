# ðŸ’« About Me:
Hello, my name is Nate if you couldn't guess and I'm a 16-year-old boy from Texas. I love to code but also do sports such as track and football! <br>    I understand that I am not the best at coding/developing but it's turned into something I do enjoy dearly and aspire to grow my strengths in!<br>    Most of my projects will be uploaded here on GitHub, and free to use by anyone! I do hope if you look at my work and have comments that<br>    you can tell me so I can improve my work.
